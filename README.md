# DV Base App

This is a the default app to talk to the DV Data Service.
It is written in Svelte@next.
It uses Auth0 to authenticate, and the DV Data Service to authorise the user.

It isn't particularly complex, and should be pretty easy to just dive in and go for it - it is MIT licenced, so, feel free to fork / swipe code from / make pull requests etc.

@blairn maintains a simplified version, without any DV specific code. So if you are just grabbing it as a shell project, use that one. This project is forked from that one, if you are looking for it.

## Developing

`npm install`

```bash
npm run dev
